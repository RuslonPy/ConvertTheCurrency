Regarding the Testing case:

1. Unit Testing:
   Unit tests should verify that the conversion logic works correctly. 
   This includes:
Testing a successful conversion from one currency to another.
Testing conversions with different amounts and currency pairs.
Verifying that the converted amount is rounded to two decimal places.
Testing error scenarios, such as when one of the currencies is not supported.
fetchConversionRate method: Unit tests should verify that the method fetches the conversion rate correctly from the external APIs. This includes:
Mocking WebClient calls to simulate responses from both API providers.
Testing scenarios where the first API provider fails to provide a conversion rate, and the method switches to the second provider.
Testing scenarios where both API providers fail to provide a conversion rate, and the method returns an empty Mono.

2. Integration Testing:
    Integration tests should ensure that the CurrencyConversionService class interacts correctly with the WebClient and handles actual HTTP requests and responses.
Mocking external API responses may not provide complete coverage, so integration tests can complement unit tests by testing real API interactions.
Integration tests should cover scenarios such as successful conversions, network errors, and API provider failures.

3. Edge Cases and Error Handling:
    Test edge cases such as when the amount to be converted is zero or negative, unsupported currencies, and extreme values.
Test error handling for scenarios such as network timeouts, connection errors, and unexpected responses from the API providers.
